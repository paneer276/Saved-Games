Despite the rainy weather, the park was filled with families enjoying their day. Children ran around, laughing and playing games, while parents sat on benches, chatting and enjoying the scenery. However, the wet ground and slippery conditions made it difficult for some people to walk, and a few even slipped and fell. Despite the minor mishaps, the overall atmosphere was cheerful and lively, with a sense of camaraderie among those who braved the rain to enjoy the park.
